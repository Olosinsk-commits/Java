/**
 * Write a static method that takes a string as argument, then prints out a
 * table: for each character that occurs in the string, the table contains the
 * character and its frequency of occurrence. Assume that the string contains
 * only ASCII characters. Suggested approach: Create an array of short integers,
 * where each element is holding frequency of occurrence of a character with
 * specific character code. The element of the array is associated with the
 * character ASCII code via element index, for example element with index 65 is
 * holding the frequency of character A. Use the array as storage for the
 * frequencies of the characters, incrementing the corresponding frequency each
 * time you encounter the character in the given string. Requirement: The method
 * must be efficient â€“ it must complete the task with only ONE pass through the
 * string.
