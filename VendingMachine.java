  Vending Machine   
  Write a program that determines the change to be dispensed from a vending 
  machine. An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 1 dollar, 
  in 5-cent increments (25, 30, 35,â€¦, 90, 95, 100), and the machine accepts
  only a single dollar bill to pay for the item. For example, 
  a possible sample dialog might be the following:
  Enter price of item (from 25 cents to a dollar, in 5-cent increments):
      45
      You bought an item for 45 cents and gave me a dollar,
      So your change is 
      2 quarters 
      0 dimes, and
      1 nickels.
